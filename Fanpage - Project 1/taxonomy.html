        Species Characteristics:
        <ul>
          <li>Boom Lifts are named for their characteristically extending "Booms" (see <a href="morphology.html">Morphology</a>).</li>
          <li>The common Boom lift represents the type species of the Aerial Work Platform genus.</li>
          <li>Across all of the construction environments in the world, boom lifts are the most common type of Aerial Work Platform.</li>
          <li>They are believed to persist on a diet of star leaves.</li>
          <li>Two subspecies of Boom Lifts exist: the Articulated Boom Lift and the Telescopic Boom Lift.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Articulated boom lift: features unfolding sections for increasing or decreasing height (lifty boi belongs to this subspecies).</li>
              <li>Articulated boom lift: features telescoping sections that maximize distance in a particular direction.</li>
            </ul>
